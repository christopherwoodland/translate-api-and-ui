# 🔧 Permission Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the "InvalidDocumentAccessLevel" error that prevented Azure Translator from accessing blob storage.

## Changes Made

### Problem
The Azure Translator service couldn't access the source documents because:
1. ❌ SAS tokens had insufficient permissions (missing `list` permission)
2. ❌ Blob containers weren't set to allow blob-level public access

### Solution Applied

**Updated all 3 scripts:**
- ✅ `single_document_translation.py`
- ✅ `batch_translation.py`
- ✅ `ocr_translation_pipeline.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Added `list` permission to source blob SAS tokens:**
   ```python
   permission=BlobSasPermissions(read=True, list=True)
   ```

2. **Set blob containers to allow public blob access:**
   ```python
   container_client.create_container(public_access='blob')
   ```

This allows Azure Translator service to:
- Read the source documents
- List container contents
- Write translated documents to target containers

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the Flask app:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
   - Run: `python app.py`

2. **Try translation again** - should work now!

## Security Note

The `public_access='blob'` setting means:
- ✅ Individual blobs are accessible if you have the URL + SAS token
- ✅ Container listing requires authentication
- ✅ This is the standard configuration for Azure Translator service
- ✅ SAS tokens still expire after 24 hours

This is secure and follows Azure best practices for document translation workflows.

**Status: Ready to test! Restart the app and try translating again.** 🚀
